Better Hire Saul(o)!
====================
Hey!

A nice (and cheap) way to market yourself huh?

In this little project, we expect to see:
-----------------------------------------
- [Tecnologies](#technologies)
- [Architecture](#arch)
- [Features](#features)
- [License](#license)

Technologies
------------
Well, It's only a static page, so don't expect complex backend frameworks, design-patterns, or integration with other platforms (yet).

##Backend
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) - Want an easier backend server?

##Frontend
- [NPM]() - Controlling our dependencies
- [Pug2]() - HTML preprocessor, you ain't gonna see html in this project
  (jk, our index will be .html)
- [Stylus]() - CSS preprocessor, since CSS, well, sucks
- [React]() - F*ck, why not
- [Webpack 2]() - Yeah... ok

##Design
- [Sketch]() - All Sketch Artwork will be placed in an orphan branch "design"

Architecture

Features
