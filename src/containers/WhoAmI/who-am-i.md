# Who am I
My name is Saulo Toshiichi Furuta, 23 years old!
Nice to meet y'all ;)
I currently live in São Paulo - Brazil.
But I wasn't born there. I'm actually from a small town in the surrounding of the metropolis, named Mogi das Cruzes, where I spent most of my youth.
After I enrolled in my College - Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo (USP) - I moved to São Paulo, to ease my daily commute

#### TL;DR

## Background
Living in Brazil, my highschool didn't offer much programming opportunities, so sadly I've began only to program only in College.
Even so, during my early years of College, I never knew I would love to program.
Luckly, I was able to do an internship on a lovely "mobile app boutique" named Taqtile, where I've began to understand the beauty in so many lines of white text in black screen.
Since then, I've been able to work on many projects, mobile and web, helping companies, such as Certsys and Qulture.Rocks, to deliver the most beautiful of experiences.

#### TL;DR
```
var background = [

    },
    {

    },
];

##### Why you always did only 4 months in each internship?
Due to my college policy, from the third year, every year is now divided in quarters.
Sacrificing(?) our summer vacations, we are able to work full time during the quarter of internship, but we are limited to the companies willing to hire us.
The third year starts with a quarter of classes (from Jan 1, 201X to May 01, 201X), and intercalates with working quarters from then till the end of graduation, summing 4 quarters of wokring, and 5 of classes.
